    Increase grey item selling responsiveness
    
    This commit adds a call to the PickupMerchantItem() API function in order
    to send items to the merchant one at a time while the selling loop is
    running.
    
    I added this since I noticed that it took a long time before my grey
    items would disappear from my inventory. Sometimes they wouldn't disappear
    until I closed and reopened my bags.
